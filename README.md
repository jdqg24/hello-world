Hello!

I'm planning to start using Unity 3D.

Unfortunately, I don't have a "New Generation" computer. My projects have to be simple, but I think with my strong spirit I have the oportunity to create an "Ultra remasterized Resident Evil 7" or a "Grand Theft Auto V 2.0 with maximum graphics".
                                                                      Ok no, I'm joking.
                                                                  I think my game is going to have only 5 polygons...
